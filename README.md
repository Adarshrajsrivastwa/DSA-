# Data Structure & Algorithms (DSA)
A repository to store different types of Data-Structure & Algorithms for educational and research purposes.

This repository is divided into 2 parts:
- [`DataStructure`](DataStructure): Contains the Data Structure
- [`Algorithms`](Algorithms): Contains Alorithms.

Each has its own hierarchy system. The hierarchy is _strict_, and must be followed.

## Hierarchy & Rules
- Directory names should be in `PascalCase`.
- There could be links to and from the Algorithms or DataStructure dir to link related things.
- The heirarchy should follow
  
  |                     Location                                 |         Purpose                                                    |
  |--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |`/Algorithms/AlgorithmCategory/AlgorithmName/`                | Store all about the algorithm (code, information, assets)          |
  |`/Algorithms/AlgorithmCategory/AlgorithmName/README.md`       | Information, pseudocode and explaination of the Algorithm          |
  |`/DataStructure/Category/SubCategory/../Name/`                | Store all about the data-structure (implementation, info, assets)  |
  |`/DataStructure/Category/SubCategory/../Name/README.md`       | Information, diagram, and explanation of the Data-Structure        |

- The data structure's heirarchy could be as follows
