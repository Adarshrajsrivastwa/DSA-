# Algorithms
This directory holds pseudocode for all the algorithms that we come across. This could be used to develop better algorithms and to optmize different algorithms to suit better in certain scenarios.

## Hierarchy
This repository follows should follow strict hierarchy.

Folders for different types of Algorithms

1. **Search Algorithms**
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Polynomial Search
2. **Sorting Algorithms**
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Radix Sort
  * Bubble Sort
3. **Path Finding Algorithms**
  * Dijkstra's algorithm
  * A<sup>*</sup> algorithm
4. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**
5. **Greedy Algorithms**
6. **Recursive Algorithms**
7. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
8. **Encryption/Decryption Algorithms**

The sub-folders in this directory, named after the algorithm will contain the pseudocode in README.md file along with its general analysis. There could be optional implementation in C++/Java or in other languages, kept in tha same directory as the README.md file.

### Notations for the Time Complexity

Use respective symbols for representing the time complexity.
- `Ω` Big Omega for `Best Case`
- `Θ` Big Theta for `Average Case`
- `O` Big O for `Worst Case`

> [!Note]
> Use the specific order (best, avg, worst) for the time complexity.
